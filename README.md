# Techno Twist
OSU MakeOHI/O 2020 Project

Work-in-progress project that began during MakeOHI/O at OSU, with the goal of eventually being a fully-automated twister game that supports multiplayer and high scores. Uses capacitive touch sensors to detect touch.

Two different boards were used - one which is a blanket with the capacitive touch sensors embedded in it, and one that is a smaller board that is easier to prototype with.

Current features:
- LED display with random spinner
- Detection of multiple hands and feet on the mat

Upcoming features (put on hold by COVID-19):
- Multiplayer support
- Logic to remember where hands/legs are and ensure that all arms and hands are in proper places
- High score table
- Wireless connection to spinner
